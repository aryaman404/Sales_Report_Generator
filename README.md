# Sales_Report_Generator
This script demonstrates key JavaScript fundamentals, including functions, arrays, objects, and JSON data manipulation. It processes student data to calculate average scores and determine their pass/fail status.  

Key Concepts: 
JSON Data Handling: Accessing and iterating through nested data structures. Functions: Custom logic for evaluating pass/fail based on average scores. Arrays and Objects: Using JavaScript data structures effectively. Loops and Conditionals: Processing data dynamically. Basic Arithmetic: Calculating averages programmatically. 

How It Works: 
Student data is stored in a JSON-like format, including scores in different subjects. The script: Iterates over each student's data. Calculates the average score. Determines pass/fail status based on a score threshold (40). Outputs a summary (ID, Name, Average Score, and Status) to the CLI.

Purpose: This example serves as a simple yet effective introduction to JavaScript fundamentals, ideal for data handling, loops, and functions
